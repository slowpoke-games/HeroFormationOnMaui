### Our open source communities endeavor to:

* Be Inclusive: We are committed to being a community where everyone can join and contribute. This means using inclusive and welcoming language.
* Be Welcoming: We are committed to maintaining a safe space for everyone to be able to contribute.
* Be Respectful: We are committed to encouraging differing viewpoints, accepting constructive criticism and work collaboratively towards decisions that help the project grow. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
* Be Collaborative: We are committed to supporting what is best for our community, users and players. When we build anything for the benefit of the project, we should document the work we do and communicate to others on how this affects their work.

### Our Responsibility. As contributors, members, players or bystanders we each individually have the responsibility to behave professionally and respectfully at all times. Disrespectful and unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

* The use of violent threats, abusive, discriminatory, or derogatory language;

* Public or private harassment of any kind;
* Publishing private information, such as physical or electronic address, without permission;
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting;
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
* Enforcement and Reporting Code of Conduct Issues:

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported. [Contact us](mailto:codeofconduct@slowpoke-games.cloud). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

### Our community:

* **Contributors**, or those who add value to the project through improving Hero Formation game software and/or its services.

The community acts according to the standards written down in this Code of Conduct and will defend these standards for the benefit of the community. Leaders of any group, such as moderators of a chat channel, forums, etc.,
will exercise the right to suspend access to any person who persistently breaks our shared Code of Conduct.
